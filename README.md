# Project Documentation: HR Analytics Dashboard
## 1. Project Overview
  This Power BI project provides a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize employee attrition trends, identify contributing factors, and      support data-driven decision-making.
  The dashboard consolidates HR data to track workforce metrics such as attrition rate, demographics, education background, job satisfaction, and salary-related factors.
