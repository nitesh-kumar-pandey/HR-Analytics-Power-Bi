Project Documentation: HR Analytics Dashboard
1. Project Overview
  This Power BI project provides a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard designed to analyze and visualize employee attrition trends, identify contributing factors, and      support data-driven decision-making.
  The dashboard consolidates HR data to track workforce metrics such as attrition rate, demographics, education background, job satisfaction, and salary-related factors.

2. Objectives
  •	To monitor overall employee attrition and its distribution.
  •	To identify patterns and key reasons for attrition across different segments (age, education, salary, job role, etc.).
  •	To enable HR teams to make informed decisions for retention strategies.
  •	To create an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard for quick insights.
